# 🌾 Rice Type Classification (PyTorch + Streamlit)

This project classifies rice grains into different types based on grain morphology features such as area, perimeter, aspect ratio, eccentricity, etc. A neural network model is trained using PyTorch and deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Demo
Run the app locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
The UI allows:

Single prediction using input sliders/number fields.

Batch prediction by uploading a CSV file.

🏋️ Training Overview
The model was trained on a labeled rice dataset with morphological features extracted from grain images. The model learns to discriminate rice varieties based on shape and size characteristics.

If you're using the notebook:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
jupyter notebook
🖥️ Running the Streamlit App
1. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit torch pandas numpy
2. Run:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
🔢 Batch Prediction Format
Upload a CSV containing only the feature columns listed above (no label column required).
Example:

csv
Copy code
Area,MajorAxisLength,MinorAxisLength,Eccentricity,ConvexArea,EquivDiameter,Extent,Perimeter,Roundness,AspectRation
5000,150,60,0.92,5400,90,0.59,310,0.74,2.51
...
🏆 Results
Achieved high classification accuracy after training.

Smooth user interaction through Streamlit UI.
